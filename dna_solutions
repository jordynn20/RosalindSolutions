#solutions to DNA: Counting DNA Nucleotides from Rosalind
#Given: A DNA string s of length at most 1000 nt.
##Return: Four integers (separated by spaces) counting the respective number of times that the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' occur in s
.

#creating a new function to count the number of each nucleotide is a DNA sequence
def dna_counting(s):
  s = s.upper()
  print(s.count('A'),s.count('C'), s.count('G'),s.count('T'))
