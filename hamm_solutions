##solutions to HAMM: Counting Point Mutations

#Given two strings s and t of equal length, the Hamming distance between s and t, denoted dH(s,t), is the number of corresponding symbols that differ in s and t.

##Given: Two DNA strings s and t of equal length (not exceeding 1 kbp).
##Return: The Hamming distance dH(s,t)
