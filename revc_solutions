#The Secondary and Tertiary Structures of DNA
##Problem: In DNA strings, symbols 'A' and 'T' are complements of each other, as are 'C' and 'G'.

##The reverse complement of a DNA string s is the string sc
 formed by reversing the symbols of s, then taking the complement of each symbol (e.g., the reverse complement of "GTCA" is "TGAC").

##Given: A DNA string s of length at most 1000 bp.
##Return: The reverse complement sc of s



def reverse_complement(s):
  complement = str.maketrans({'A':'T', 'T':'A','G':'C','C':'G'})
  return s.translate(complement)[::-1]
